Data  visualisation
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a surge in the development of dashboards as dynamic, visual tools for communicating COVID-19 data. Dashboards can help with decision-making and behavior change. They must be actionable in order to do so. In this project we are going to create interactive dashboards regarding the COVID-19 vaccination progress around the world using tableau software.
Used a public dataset from Kaggle based on  covid vaccination progress around the world.
